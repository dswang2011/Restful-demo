Using Machine Learning, Squirro enables you to do more with data. Your biggest untapped resource is your data.

Most of this data is unstructured – call notes, office files, knowledge articles, emails, documents, or external data such as news, market data, research and more.

Up to 99% of this data never gets touched beyond creation. Squirro extracts and delivers the right insights to you at precisely the right time, automatically.

We call it “Augmented Intelligence” because machines augment human intelligence enabling us to make better decisions.

Doing more with your data is critical. Forrester calls it the ‘Insights Economy’ and lists Squirro as a leading vendor.
